# go-interface-examples

Some examples of using Go interfaces to make cleaner, more testable code.

## local-interfaces example

[See the code here](./local-interfaces)

This is an example of defining your interfaces locally in each package rather
than trying to do an "interface package" or providing giant interfaces from
a single package that also contains the implementation.
